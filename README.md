<h1>My take on questions from codeforces</h1>

<h3>71A: Way Too Long Words</h3>
The problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A  
  
Solution: I used 2D arrays to store the words in different rows. Maximum length of the colums is 101 including the null termination character. Abbreviation is needed if strlen in a row is greater than 10.
